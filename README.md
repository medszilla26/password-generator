## This is the password generator javascript homework

When the Generate Password button is pressed a prompt window will appear and will ask a series of questions.
First it will ask the user for the desired length of the password.
If the length meets the paramaters of 8-128 characters it then follows onto the character types; uppercase, lowercase, symbols and finally numbers. If one or more is selected then it will follow by successfully displaying a series of randomized characters in the #placeholder area.

Otherwise if length does not meet the 8-128 criteria it will prompt with a "..please try again message" and it will display a "..refresh and try again" in the #placeholder area. It will also do the same if the user fails to select any character choices.
